# NEDApay Platform Overview

## What is NEDApay?

NEDApay is a **blockchain infrastructure bridge** that creates a secondary layer for global money movement, connecting stablecoins to traditional payment rails across East Africa and beyond. We enable Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Banks, and businesses to offer instant stablecoin-to-fiat conversion services through their existing customer channels.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional cross-border payments and stablecoin adoption face significant barriers:
- **High costs** and slow settlement times (3-7 days)
- **Complex integrations** with multiple payment providers
- **Limited reach** in emerging markets
- **Regulatory compliance** challenges across jurisdictions
- **Liquidity fragmentation** across different networks

### Our Solution: The Secondary Layer

NEDApay operates as an **omni-channel protocol** that creates seamless bridges between:
- **Digital assets** (stablecoins on Base network)
- **Traditional payment rails** (mobile money, banks, PSPs)
- **Global distribution networks** (50+ payment channels)

## How NEDApay Works: The Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Gateway Smart Contract (Base Network)**
- **What it does:** Handles order creation, validation, and settlement coordination
- **Why Base:** Ultra-low fees (~$0.01), 2-3 second settlement, EVM compatibility
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Multi-currency stablecoin support (TZS, KES, UGX)
  - Event emission for network monitoring
  - Automated settlement execution
  - DeFi protocol integration

#### 2. **Aggregator Nodes**
- **What they do:** Intelligent routing layer that optimally matches orders with providers
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Monitor blockchain for new payment orders
  - Maintain provider registry and ratings
  - Execute optimal provider matching algorithms
  - Verify compliance (KYC/AML) requirements
  - Coordinate multi-party settlements

#### 3. **Provider Network**
- **Who they are:** Global network of PSPs, MNOs, banks, and liquidity providers
- **What they do:** Enable local distribution and collection
- **Examples:**
  - Mobile money: M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa, Airtel Money
  - Banks: Commercial and digital banks
  - PSPs: Regional payment processors
  - Individual liquidity providers

### Transaction Flow: A Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Sarah in London wants to send $500 to her family in rural Tanzania

#### Step 1: Order Initiation
```
Sarah's remittance app → NEDApay API → Gateway Smart Contract
```
- Sarah enters recipient details and amount
- App converts GBP to USDC using local exchange
- Creates payment order on Base network
- **Time:** 10 seconds

#### Step 2: Intelligent Routing
```
Gateway Contract → Aggregator Node → Provider Matching
```
- Aggregator detects new order event
- Analyzes available providers in Tanzania
- Selects optimal provider based on:
  - Exchange rates (USDC to TZS)
  - Settlement speed
  - Provider reliability rating
  - Geographic coverage
- **Time:** 5 seconds

#### Step 3: Provider Execution
```
Aggregator → Vodacom Tanzania → M-Pesa Distribution
```
- Vodacom receives order details
- Converts USDC to TZS at market rate
- Distributes TZS to recipient's M-Pesa wallet
- Confirms completion to aggregator
- **Time:** 15 seconds

#### Step 4: Settlement & Confirmation
```
Provider → Aggregator → Smart Contract → Sarah's App
```
- Multi-party settlement executed on Base
- All participants receive their fees
- Sarah receives confirmation with transaction hash
- Recipient gets SMS notification
- **Total Time:** 30 seconds, **Cost:** $2.50 (vs $25+ traditional)
